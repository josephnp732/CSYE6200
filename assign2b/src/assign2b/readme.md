• Write a Tractor and a  TractorTest class ( Tractor.java and  TracktorTest.java )

• To the Tractor class

• Add Strings for both the make and model
(i.e. make: Kubota, model: B2320DT)

• Add an Owner ID string (i.e. “ m.munson ”)

• Add a tractor value ( ie.e . $20,000)

• Add value for tractor power in terms of of horsepower (HP) or  KiloWatts (KW).

• Add a String to hold the fuel type (diesel, gasoline, kerosene, electric, etc.), capacity and current fuel load

• Add a constructor that sets the make and model, along with the other instance variables

• Add methods to calculate the range based on fuel load and a fuel efficiency value (kilometers per liter)

• In the  TractorTest program, use the ‘new’ operation with your Tractor constructor to generate five instances of different tractor objects.

• Move all test code (i.e. from ‘main’) and place it into a run() method. Call run() from main.

• Add a method to print an attractive display of the import tractor data including power and range

• Have your code print the contents of all the tractors

• Write a  TractorTaxation.java class

• Add a private  ArrayList for holding Tractors, and add public convenience methods that support adding, getting and removing Tractors.

• Create a public method that loops through all Tractors in the array and prints an attractive listing.

• Add a private HashMap that stores Tractors by Owner ID, and a public method to allow retrieval by the ID .

• Add a method to calculate annual tax based on a rate-per-thousand of vehicle value  – display with printed listing

• Submit your source code Blackboard as .java files. Include a copy of your program’s output captured in a text file.
